RebindMyKeys allows you to rebind normally hard-coded keybindings. It also allows escape to be used in keybindings and adds a button to allow unbinding of keys.

# Why do I want this mod?

You don't like the Debug Menu being F3 or having to press F1 to hide your HUD? Then this mod is for you. With RebindMyKeys you can rebind the Debug Menu, HUD and more!

## KeyBingins added for

- Pause / Close Menu
- Narrator
- Debug Menu
- Toggle HUD
- Debug Combinations (eg. Show Hitboxes)

**If you want me to add a KeyBinding please create an [Issue](https://github.com/agent-LuluDodo/RebindMyKeys/issues) on my GitHub!**

## Usage

### Rebind

The additional KeyBindings function just like normal KeyBindings.**¹** KeyBindings which are used with a key combination only conflict with keys using the same combination.

### Unbind

To unbind a KeyBinding simply press the "U" button. This mod removes the vanilla function of unbinding a key when you try to bind it to escape and instead allows binding keys to escape.**²**

## Notes

**¹** Support for mouse is still WIP, so you can't bind additional KeyBindings to mouse buttons.

**²** Thanks to syorito-hatsuki for pointing out that Vanilla allows you to unbind keys by pressing escape. ([Issue #1](https://github.com/agent-LuluDodo/RebindMyKeys/issues/1))
